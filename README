# GoogleCalendarClone2025
This Google Calendar clone is the capstone project for my Software Development, Frontend Specialization course through CourseCareers
The goal of this project was independently code all the logic necessary for a useable calendar including but not limited to: creating, editing, deleting events. An SDD (software design document) was provided, listing all necessary features and providing images to match in styling.
This project should function as a legitimate replacement for a personal calendar, as it stores your data in localStorage, and will "remember" your previous data when used on the same device

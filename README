# GoogleCalendarClone2025

**PURPOSE AND FUNCTION OF THE PROJECT**
This Google Calendar clone is the capstone project for my "Software Development: Frontend Specialization" course through CourseCareers.

The goal of this project was to independently code all the logic necessary for a usable calendar including but not limited to: creating, editing, and deleting events. An SDD (software design document) was provided, listing all necessary features and providing images to match in styling.

This project should function as a legitimate replacement for a personal calendar, as it stores your data in localStorage, and will "remember" your previous data when used on the same device

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP PROJECT**

-> Instructions assume that you already have (a) an account set up with a coding editor, preferably VSC, (b) node.js and git installed, and set up in your editor

# 1. First clone this project from my account, if you have not already done so.

A. Click the green button that says "Code"

B. From the Local tab, select the HTTPS option (these should be the default)

C. Copy the github link provided

# 2. Open VSC, or your editor. Run these commands from a powershell terminal

-> (if you use another editor/terminal your cmds syntax may differ slightly)

A. (if you haven't already cloned into the project) run "git clone XYZ" where XYZ is the copied github link

B. Once cloned into project, assure that you are cd'ed into the folder "GoogleCalendarClone2025" -> Note, this name may be slightly changed in the future, but should clearly name the project as demonstrated. No other folders will contain project name

C. run "npm i"

D. run "npm run dev"

# Something like this should appear in the terminal, press CTRL while clicking the underlined link to open in browser
